# ***🚀 Inventory-Shop System!***
I'm thrilled to unveil my latest creation – a comprehensive Inventory & Shop system built in Unity. I set out to create an inventory system that can be integrated with any project. This project isn’t just about buying and selling; it’s a robust framework with deep architecture, clean design patterns, and powerful features that truly enhance gameplay. Here’s a deep dive into what went into it:

## **✨ What It Does:**
### **• Dynamic Inventory Management:**
- 🔹 Track item quantities and weights with precision.
- 🔹 Seamlessly generate items with random quantities and controlled weight checks.
- 🔹 Maintain a responsive, user-friendly UI that updates instantly.

### **• Interactive Shop System:**
- 🛒 Buy and sell items effortlessly, with real-time updates to quantities and prices.
- 🛒 Handle complex transactions with pop-ups for “not enough money,” “maximum weight exceeded,” and other key alerts.
- 🛒 Display detailed item information through elegant UI panels.

### **• Robust Event-Driven Architecture:**
- 🔄 Utilize a central EventService to trigger events across systems – from item selection sounds to inventory weight changes.
- 🔄 Implement observer patterns that instantly update UI elements when player data or item states change.

### **• Modular and Scalable Design:**
- 🔧 Built with well-structured scripts, including generic controllers, models, and views.
- 🔧 Leveraged C# generics to create reusable, maintainable code.
- 🔧 Used base MVC scripts and inheritance to implement common methods across Shop and Inventory, reducing code duplication and improving consistency.
- 🔧 Employed ScriptableObjects for item definitions, ensuring flexibility and easy data management.

### **• User Experience Enhancements:**
- 🎮 Utilized Toggle for smooth transitions between Shop and Inventory.
- 🎮 Designed an intuitive UI with clear indicators and seamless mode switches.
- 🎮 Integrated real-time audio feedback via a dedicated SoundService and SoundManager for immersive interactions.
- 🎮 Managed UI panels effectively using CanvasGroup for enhanced control over visibility and interactivity.
- 🎮 Presented visual pop-ups for critical alerts like weight limits and insufficient funds to enhance player feedback.

## **💡 Key Learnings & Technologies:**
### **• Design Patterns & Architecture:**
- 🔹 Mastered the Observer Pattern to handle complex, event-driven interactions.
- 🔹 Implemented Generic Classes and interfaces for a scalable, reusable codebase.
- 🔹 Designed a modular system with clear separation between Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC).

### **• Advanced C# Techniques:**
- 🔹 Utilized Actions, delegates, and events for flexible communication between components.
- 🔹 Created custom, generic singletons (like GenericMonoSingleton) to manage core game systems.

### **• UI/UX Mastery:**
- 🔹 Developed dynamic UI panels and toggles for effortless switching between shop and inventory.
- 🔹 Integrated pop-up notifications and dynamic transaction sections (buying/selling) for enhanced user interaction.

### **• Agile & Iterative Development:**
- 🔹 Built configurable systems within the Unity Editor to rapidly iterate and fine-tune gameplay.
- 🔹 Overcame performance challenges with a well-synchronized, event-driven design.

This project is a culmination of deep technical learning and creative problem-solving. I’m excited to see where this robust system takes my game development journey next!
